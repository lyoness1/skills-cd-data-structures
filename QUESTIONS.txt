QUESTIONS

Runtime
1) The workload would be the length of the list
2) 1, logn, n, nlogn, n^2, 2^n

Stacks
1) 1. Stack, 2. Queue, 3. What?
2) Print queue, task list
3) Undo, back button

Linked Lists
1) The nodes are apple, berry, and cherry. The head is apple, the tail is cherry. 
The data is the string of the fruit, and the pointer is the arrow. 
2) Singly linked lists only point forward, whereas a doubly linked list points
in both forward and backwards directions along the list. 
3) Keeping track of the tail allows appending to happen regardless of the other
data in the list beforehand. It doesn't have to iterate through to find the end
and the runtime will be faster. 

Trees
1) Food, Italian, Indian, Mexican, lasagna, pizza, tikka masala, saag, burrito!
2) Food, Mexican, enchiladas, tacos, burrito, Indian, saag, tikka masala (yum),
Italian, pizza, Sicilian, New York-style, Chicago-style! 
3) Bianary search trees only have two branches from each node, and one child is 
always 'less than' the parent node, and the other is always 'greater than'.
